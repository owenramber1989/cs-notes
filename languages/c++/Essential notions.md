# List initialization
1. int a = 0;
2. int a = {0};
3. int a{0}
4. int a(0)
Using the curly braces to initialize is the so-called ***list initialization***.  The compiler will not let us list initialize variables of built-in type if the initializer might lead to the loss of information. i.e. You can not do sth like int a = {foo/\*which is long double type\*/}.
# Scope
Since the global scope does not have a name, so when the scope operator has an empty left-hand side, it is a request to fetch the name on the right-hand side from the global scope.
Pay special attention to the 3rd one. **::reused**.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
// Program for illustration purposes only: It is bad style for a function
// to use a global variable and also define a local variable with the same name
int reused = 42;
 // reused has global scope
int main()
{
int unique = 0; // unique has block scope
// output #1: uses global reused; prints 42 0
std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
int reused = 0; // new, local object named reused hides global reused
// output #2: uses local reused; prints 0 0
std::cout << reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
// output #3: explicitly requests the global reused; prints 42 0
std::cout << ::reused << " " << unique << std::endl;
return 0;
}
```
# reference
There are two kinds of refs - the lvalue ref and the rvalue ref.
|lvalue ref|rvalue ref|
|---|---|
|use &|use &&|
|addressable|&#10008|
|assignable|&#10008|

Generally lvalue can be modified while rvalue not(in the context of basic types). User-defined rvalue ref can be modified by member function.
# test
In this minute I will type into some meaningless words just to verify where or not can this auto push feature works. If I can see these new lines in the github platform then fine.
